⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy integrating cutting-edge technologies to build scalable, real-time applications with seamless user experiences.

I'm a seasoned full-stack developer with a strong foundation in React.js for crafting dynamic, user-focused interfaces. My front-end toolkit includes Tailwind CSS for responsive design and Framer Motion for fluid animations. On the backend, I actively work with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to build secure, scalable APIs and server-side systems. I thrive in collaborative, agile environments and am driven to deliver maintainable, high-performance digital solutions that bridge the gap between front-end aesthetics and backend efficiency.
