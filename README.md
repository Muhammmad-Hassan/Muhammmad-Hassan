⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy building real-time, scalable applications and exploring ways to optimize backend performance while delivering seamless user experiences.

I’m a full-stack developer with strong expertise in backend development. My main stack includes Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, where I build secure, scalable, and efficient server-side systems.

I thrive in collaborative environments and love delivering maintainable, high-performance solutions that connect powerful backends with engaging frontends.
